As I picked up intrest in building Github `User Pages` as index of my repository, I am using `Jekyll` which is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. 

Besides [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Github Help][github-help], [A guide to using Github Pages][using-github-pages] is a very good resource to start.

[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/
[github-help]: https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/ 
[using-github-pages]: https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/
